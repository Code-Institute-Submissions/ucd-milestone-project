# UCD Milestone Project for Codeinstitute Full Stack Course

I have created a Formula One fan page with some information about the circuits, drivers and teams, because of my love of the sport.

## Target Audience and Functionality

To provide any person who are unfamiliar with the sport a little description of the sport and some basic, uncomplicated information to attract them.
To provide any existing fans of the sport some topical information about their favourite circuits/drivers/teams in an easy to read format to avoid accessing from multiple sources.
Also provides a direct link to all social media sources for the sport across various platforms (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Youtube, Official website).
