# UCD Milestone Project for Codeinstitute Full Stack Course

## Criteria

Guideleines from the Codeinstitute:

1. Create a website of around 4-5 pages, or (if using a single scrolling page) these should be separate page areas.
2. Incorporate main navigation and grid layout (you might want to use Flexbox or Bootstrap to accomplish this).
3. Whenever possible, strive to use semantic HTML5 elements to structure your HTML code better.
4. Make sure your site is as responsive as possible. You can test this by checking the website on different screen sizes and browsers.
5. We advise that you write down user stories and create wireframes/mockups before embarking on full-blown development.
6. The site can also make use of CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap, just make sure you maintain a clear separation between the library code and your code.
7. You should conduct and document tests to ensure that all of your websiteâ€™s functionality works well.
8. Write a README.md file for your project that explains what the project does and the need that it fulfills. It should also describe the functionality of the project, as well as the technologies used. Detail how the project was deployed and tested and if some of the work was based on other code, explain what was kept and how it was changed to fit your need. A project submitted without a README.md file will FAIL.
9. Use Git & GitHub for version control. Each new piece of functionality should be in a separate commit.
10. Deploy the final version of your code to a hosting platform such as GitHub Pages.

## Overview

I have created a Formula One fan page with some information about the circuits, drivers and teams, because of my love of the sport.

The Official Formula one website is very detailed and complex and people unfamiliar with the sport may be confused by all the information it contains. Because I am a huge fan of the sport and there is much media sources online it was very
easy for me to formulate ideas and find assets allowing me to simplify the site as much as possible and make it and easy user experience for any visitors to the page. 

## Target Audience and Functionality

To provide any persons who are unfamiliar with the sport a little description of the sport and some basic, uncomplicated information to attract them.

To provide any existing fans of the sport some topical information about their favourite circuits/drivers/teams in an easy to read format to avoid accessing from multiple sources.

Also provides a direct link to all social media sources for the sport across various platforms (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Youtube, Official website).


## Mockup/Wireframes

For the design process I used **ADOBE XD** to create some simple wireframe mockups that can be veiwed below.

## Styling

I opted to try and keep the styling as simple as possible and easy to look at whilst still maintaining good functionality and presence.

The red colouring used is the offical F1 red and the rest of the colours were chosen for the background and texts as I feel these complemented the design very well and did not clash, keeping the screen less busy.

Mobile first responsive design was used implementing bootstrap where necessary for all pages to ensure fluid movements on various screen sizes and this was tested in the chrom dev tools and on my own andorid smartphone.


## Challenges

I faced challenges when writing this code. Firstly the adjustments ot the nav bar for changing the colours and making it responsive for the "hamburger" to appear. I overcame this by using the bootstrap website for further tricks with the navbars.
This was a complicated piece of coding that took longer than expected so maybe should have a way to simplify this in future.

Second challenge I faced was to make the embedded video responsive whilst still mainting its aspect ratio. Normal bootstrap coding caused the static image of the video to be under-sized and also resulted in the "black lines"
around the vide changing vertically and horizontally depending on the screen-size. I overcame this by using a ratio calculator with the CSS that I found from an outside source and adapted to fit my sites purpose.
Documentation for that can be found [here](https://css-tricks.com/NetMag/FluidWidthVideo/Article-FluidWidthVideo.php).
